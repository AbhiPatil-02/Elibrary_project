# Getting Started with Create React App and the project

## **ELibrary Web Application â€“ Experiential Learning Project**

ðŸ“š Introduction

eLibrary is a digital library management system designed to help users organize, manage, and access books, articles, and other digital resources efficiently. This project provides an intuitive interface for searching, borrowing, and managing digital books.


As part of our academic experiential learning, our team worked together to create a web-based eLibrary application. This platform allows users to browse, search, and access a collection of e-books and other digital resources. While building this application, we focused on making it easy to use, ensuring smooth navigation, and organizing the data properly for quick access. This project helped us understand how websites work, including both the front-end (what users see) and the back-end (how data is managed). It also taught us the importance of making a user-friendly and efficient system.

Apart from technical learning, this project also helped us improve our teamwork and problem-solving skills. We worked closely as a team, shared tasks, and solved challenges together, such as fixing errors, improving performance, and ensuring data security. Through this experience, we learned how to manage a project from start to finish, communicate effectively, and apply our knowledge to a real-world scenario. Overall, building the eLibrary was a great learning experience that helped us grow both technically and personally.
